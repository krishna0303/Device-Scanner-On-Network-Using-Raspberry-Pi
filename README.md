## About

An attempt to create a device which can scan all the devices connected on the same network and it will show the Device Name, MAC Address and IP address to the owner via app.
An owner can allow or block this device from their network from anywhere by using this app.

## Build Setup

To run this project succesfully you have to follow some important steps after succesfully cloning this repository into your local device.

1)React Native Setup

Open [React Native Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to view it in the browser.

2)React Native Setup with Firebase

Open [React Native Setup with Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/) to view it in the browser.

2)Python with firebase

Open [Python with Firebase](https://pypi.org/project/python-firebase/) to view it in the browser.

After Successfully setup of environment run python code.py from Raspberry PI OS to see the result:

### `python code.py`

In order to see the output in app run below command from another terminal to build the app and to show results:

Run these both command concurrently:
### `npm run android`   



### Requirements

Nmap to scan the devices and find their details like device name, IP and MAC address.



## Add-Ons

- [X] Scanning data and send to firebase
- [X] fetch from firebase and show data via app to the user
- [ ] Adding block and allow options with functionality.
- [ ] Improving app UI
- [ ] Implementing notification whenever new device connected to that network

## Deployment

In progress
